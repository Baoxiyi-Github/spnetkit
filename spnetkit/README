1.Introduction

spnetkit is a C++ wrapper for BSD-style sockets. It implements the
TCP, UDP, SSL transport layer protocols. Implemented application layer
protocols are HTTP client, SMTP client, POP3 client. Features include
inifile reader, base64 codec.

The spnetkit code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested
under Solaris.

You can get the code from the spnetkit home page:

	http://code.google.com/p/spnetkit/

2.Building

To build libspnetkit.so, type

$ cd spnetkit
$ make

This will build all the targets include examples. 

Before building libspnetkit_s.so, OpenSSL must been installed.
Edit spnetkit/Makefile to specify the path of openssl:

	OPENSSL_INCL = -I<path_to_openssl_include>
	OPENSSL_LIB  = -L<path_to_openssl_library> -lssl -lcrypto

$ make ssl


Reports of successful use of spnetkit are appreciated.

Enjoy!
